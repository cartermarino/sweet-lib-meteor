THIS WILL BE A README EVENTUALLY.

### Timeline
You will have from right now until 2PM on Thursday to work with your group. At 2:30PM on Thursday presentations will start. Each group will have 20 minutes to present.

##### Quick start guide
Each group needs to create a getting started tutorial on their topic. It should be:

- Written in markdown and on a Github Repo
- You should include screen shots, gifs, diagrams, or other tools that will help make the guide as useful as possible (but don't waste time on styling, this project is about content, not style).
- You should look to the offical docs/start guides for inspiration, but make yours more approachable for WDI students. Think about what assumed knowledge is in the offical docs, and unassume it. Fill in the missing pieces.
- Make sure to note dependencies, and similarities/differences to other types of tech we've studied.
- Any code files that are needed should be included in this repo. This includes Gemfiles or package.json!

#### An App
- Meteor - create an app that lets you either chat, collaborate, or send data/alerts in real time to groups of people with the built in socket connections.

##### Presentation
Each group needs to prepare a presentation where they walk the rest of the class through the basics of the library/framework, demo the app they made, and talk about what use cases the tech has. Why would someone choose to use your group's tech? You should be prepared to answer questions from the class - and when you are in the audience, ask questions of the other groups. You should feel free to use whatever teaching techniques you'd like! Make to to make your presentations interesting and engaging, as everyone has to sit through them :).
